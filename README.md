# Logistic Regression Implementation

This project demonstrates the implementation of logistic regression using both loop-based and vectorized styles. The purpose is to compare the performance and efficiency of these two approaches.

## Project Structure

- `main.py`: Main Python script containing the implementation of logistic regression, training, and evaluation.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn

You can install the necessary libraries using the following command:
```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib scikit-learn

```

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
 ```bash
git clone https://github.com/munibakar/Implementation-of-Logistic-Regression-in-Python.git

```
2. Run the script:
 ```bash
python main.py

```
The script will train logistic regression models using both loop and vectorized styles, plot the cost convergence, and display confusion matrices for both approaches.

## Results
- The script prints the time taken by each method (loop vs. vectorized) and shows the cost convergence over 1000 epochs.
- Confusion matrices for the test dataset are displayed for both methods.
